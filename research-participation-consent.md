# Research Participation Consent

**Cassandra Labs Foundation, Inc.** A 501(c)(3) Charitable, Educational, and Scientific Organization

***

### Overview

Cassandra Labs Foundation ("Cassandra Labs," "we," or "us") is a nonprofit research organization dedicated to building public-goods infrastructure and conducting research for the benefit of its members and the public. This Research Participation Consent describes how your data may be used for research if you choose to join the Cassandra Labs Association through OpenClaims.

**Your use of OpenClaims does not require you to join Cassandra Labs.** OpenClaims is a claims-recovery service operated by Cheda, Inc. ("Cheda"), our technology partner. You may use OpenClaims to discover and file class action settlement claims without joining Cassandra Labs or consenting to research participation.

If you choose to join the Cassandra Labs Association, contributing your anonymized data to our research program is one of the ways you participate in the Association's charitable, educational, and scientific mission. This is entirely voluntary — it is your choice whether to join.

Please read this document carefully before affirming your consent.

### 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age to join the Cassandra Labs Association and to consent to research participation. By affirming your consent, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older.

***

### 2. Purpose of Research

Cassandra Labs conducts research in furtherance of its mission under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our research aims to advance public understanding of topics including, but not limited to, access to justice, financial inclusion, consumer rights recovery, and the design of public-goods infrastructure.

Your participation contributes to this mission by allowing us to include your anonymized and aggregated data in our research analyses. Cassandra Labs is committed to publishing the results of its research, including at minimum an annual research summary shared with all Association members.

### 3. What Data We Collect and How It Is Shared

Your data comes from two sources: information you provide directly during enrollment, and information shared with us by Cheda under a data-sharing arrangement described below.

#### 3a. Information You Provide

During enrollment, you provide:

* **Identity information**: Name, email address, phone number (optional), and physical address
* **Membership preferences**: Participation interests, meeting preferences, and initiative interests

#### 3b. Information Shared by Cheda

Cassandra Labs and Cheda, Inc. maintain a data-sharing agreement under which Cheda may share the following categories of OpenClaims usage data with Cassandra Labs for members who have affirmatively consented to research participation:

* **Claim activity**: Types of settlements explored, categories of claims filed, and claim outcomes
* **Engagement patterns**: Frequency of use, settlement categories of interest, and general usage activity

Cheda shares this data with Cassandra Labs solely for research purposes and only for users who have consented through this form. **Cheda does not share this data for users who have not joined the Cassandra Labs Association.** Cheda's own use of your data is governed by [Cheda's Privacy Policy](https://cheda.com/privacy).

#### 3c. Data We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect or receive from Cheda: Social Security numbers, bank account or payment card numbers, government-issued identification numbers, or specific settlement payment amounts tied to individual members.

### 4. How Your Data Is Used for Research

All research conducted by Cassandra Labs using member data adheres to the following principles:

* **Anonymization**: Before any data is used for research, it is stripped of personally identifiable information. No individual member can be identified in any published research output.
* **Aggregation**: Data is analyzed and reported only in aggregate form. Individual-level data is never disclosed in research publications, presentations, or reports.
* **Mission alignment**: Research outputs are used exclusively to advance Cassandra Labs' charitable, educational, and scientific purposes as defined in our bylaws.
* **No sale of data**: We do not sell, rent, license, or trade member data — whether identifiable or anonymized — to third parties for commercial purposes.

Research outputs may include academic papers, public reports, policy recommendations, conference presentations, and internal analyses shared with Cassandra Labs members.

### 5. Your Rights

As a research participant, you have the right to:

* **Access**: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
* **Correction**: Request correction of inaccurate personal data.
* **Withdrawal**: Withdraw your research consent at any time (see Section 6).
* **Deletion**: Request deletion of your identifiable data.
* **Inquire**: Ask questions about our research activities and how your data is used.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information in Section 8. We will acknowledge your request within seven (7) days and complete it within thirty (30) days, or notify you if additional time is needed.

***

### 6. Withdrawal of Consent

You may withdraw your research consent at any time by contacting us at the address in Section 8. Withdrawal is effective upon confirmation, which we will provide within seven (7) days.

Upon withdrawal:

* Your identifiable data will be removed from active research datasets within thirty (30) days.
* Data that has already been anonymized and incorporated into completed research analyses cannot be retroactively removed, as it is no longer linked to you.
* Withdrawal of research consent does not automatically terminate your Cassandra Labs membership. You may remain a member and participate in the Association through other means (volunteering, voting, attending meetings, etc.). However, if research participation was your primary form of engagement, you should contact us to discuss alternative participation options.
* Withdrawal does not affect your ability to continue using OpenClaims.

***

### 7. Amendments

Cassandra Labs may update this Research Participation Consent from time to time. For material changes to the scope of data collected, how data is used, or your rights, we will notify you by email and request your re-affirmation of consent before the changes take effect. If you do not re-affirm consent within thirty (30) days of notification, your research participation will be paused until consent is re-affirmed, but your membership will not be affected.
