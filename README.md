# OpenClaim

#### Our Mission

\[Organization Name] is a public benefit program of Cassandra Labs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to \[mission statement].

We built this platform because class action settlements often go unclaimed - billions of dollars that rightfully belong to consumers sit unclaimed every year because:

* People don't know they're eligible
* The claims process is confusing
* Deadlines pass unnoticed
* Forms are difficult to complete

Our platform helps ensure that everyday people can access the money they're owed from class action settlements.

#### Our Commitment

* We only succeed when you succeed (contingent fee model)
* We provide the technology at cost to maximize benefit to claimants
* We support the ecosystem of consumer protection through class actions
* All surplus revenues support \[Cassandra Labs' charitable mission]
