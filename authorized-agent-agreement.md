# Authorized Agent Agreement

This Authorized Agent & Membership Dues Agreement (“**Agreement**”) is entered into by and between **\[NONPROFIT LEGAL NAME]**, a **\[STATE]** nonprofit corporation (“**Organization**”), and the individual accepting these terms (“**Member**”).

**Effective Date:** \[DATE]

### 1) Purpose and scope

**1.1 Purpose (payout-only).** Member wishes to use Organization’s tools and services solely to help Member **obtain payment of claim proceeds** (including settlement, restitution, refund, or similar payments) by preparing and submitting Member-provided information to the applicable settlement administrator, paying agent, or other payor (each, an “**Administrator**”) (the “**Services**”).

**1.2 No funds custody.** Organization will **not** receive, take custody of, control, or disburse claim proceeds for Member. Claim proceeds are directed by Member to be paid **to Member** (or to Member’s designated payment endpoint) by the Administrator.

**1.3 Non-exclusivity.** Member may file directly with the Administrator without using Organization’s Services.

**1.4 Who we are.**&#x20;

* We are a technology platform.
* We are not your attorney.
* We act only as a limited authorized agent for ministerial transmission tasks as described in the Authorized Agent Agreement.
* The Administrator’s relationship is with you; The Administrator decides eligibility/payment.

### 2) What we do (and what we do not do)

**2.1 Services include (ministerial only):**

* collecting Member’s identifying information and payment delivery instructions for submission;
* pre-filling and submitting Administrator forms using Member-provided information;
* transmitting documents Member provides to support a submission (if any);
* monitoring status, relaying Administrator communications, and reminding Member of deadlines.

**2.2 Services exclude (no legal services; no advocacy; no appeals).** Organization does **not**:

* provide legal advice, interpret legal rights, or advise Member whether to file;
* select legal strategy or advise which settlement elections maximize outcomes;
* determine or opine that Member is eligible (Member certifies their own statements);
* **advocate, negotiate, or argue** on Member’s behalf with an Administrator or any other person;
* **contest denials, draft appeals, prepare appeal narratives, or submit dispute arguments** intended to persuade an Administrator to approve, increase, or accelerate a payment; or
* prepare sworn statements, affidavits, declarations, or other legal instruments for Member.

**2.3 Member self-certification.** Member understands Organization transmits Member’s information and certifications, and the Administrator decides eligibility, acceptance, payment amount (if any), and timing.

**2.4 Operational covenant.** If an Administrator asks a question or requests information that requires substantive judgment (including interpretation of eligibility criteria, evidentiary sufficiency, elections, or dispute/appeal positions), Organization will not respond with a substantive answer on Member’s behalf. Instead, Organization may (a) relay the request to Member, (b) transmit Member’s written response verbatim or as directed by Member, and/or (c) direct Member to respond to the Administrator directly. If a settlement administrator requests clarification, additional documentation, or supplemental information regarding your claim:

1. **We notify you immediately** via email and in-app notification
2. **You have \[14] days** to provide the requested information through the Platform
3. **We relay your response** to the administrator verbatim
4. **If you do not respond** within \[14] days, we will:
   * Send one reminder notification
   * Mark the claim as "Awaiting Member Response".

### 3) Limited authorization to act as agent

**3.1 Appointment.** Member appoints Organization as Member’s **limited authorized agent** solely to perform the Services described in Section 2.1 for the specific claims that Member affirmatively selects or authorizes through the platform (“**Covered Claims**”).

**3.2 No assignment.** This is an agency authorization, not an assignment. Member retains ownership of all claims and all payment rights.

**3.3 Payment direction.** Member authorizes Organization to provide Member’s payment delivery information (including ACH instructions for **credit** deposits, where supported) to the Administrator **for payment to Member**.

**3.4 Revocation.** Member may revoke this agency authorization by canceling membership as described in Section 10. Revocation stops future submissions and communications by Organization but does not undo prior submissions already made.

**3.5 No Power of Attorney.** Member does not grant Organization a power of attorney, express or implied. Organization’s authority is limited to the ministerial, claim-transmission facilitation described in this Agreement.

### 4) Member obligations and acknowledgements

**4.1 Accurate information.** Member will provide accurate, complete, and current information and promptly update changes.

**4.2 Supporting documentation.** Member will provide supporting documents reasonably requested by an Administrator when available.

**4.3 Administrator decides.** Member understands the Administrator may reject, delay, or reduce payment for any reason, including missing or inconsistent information.

**4.4 No guarantees.** Organization does not guarantee acceptance, timing, or any payment outcome.

### 5) Membership dues

**5.1 Dues formula.** In consideration of the Services, Member agrees to pay **Membership Dues** equal to **\[PERCENT]%** of **Net Proceeds Received** by Member from **Covered Claims** submitted through the Services during an active membership term.

**5.2 Definitions.**

* **“Value of Proceeds Received”** means the amount actually received by Member from an Administrator for a Covered Claim (including multiple installments if paid in parts), excluding any amounts reversed, clawed back, or not finally received by Member.
* **“Covered Claim”** means a claim submission that Organization prepares and submits using Member-provided information **after** Organization provides Member a written **Submission Notice** identifying the claim (including the Administrator/payor and a summary of the key submission details) and Member **does not opt out** within the Opt-Out Period.
* **“Submission Notice”** means a notice delivered by email and/or in-app message that (i) identifies the specific claim and Administrator/payor, (ii) describes the information Organization intends to submit, and (iii) provides a clear method to opt out.
* **“Opt-Out Period”** means **\[5] business days** after the Submission Notice is sent (or such longer period stated in the Submission Notice). If Member opts out within the Opt-Out Period, Organization will not submit that claim using the Platform.

**5.3 Minimum (optional).** Organization may waive de minimis dues amounts and may set a minimum per payment of $\[MIN] to avoid trivial debits. (If you don’t want this, delete Section 5.3.)

**5.4 No hidden multipliers; dues are only as stated.** Membership Dues consist solely of the percentage described in Section 5.1 (and any expressly authorized third-party pass-through costs, if you choose to include Section 5.5). Organization will not charge “processing fees,” “whichever is higher” add-ons, or other amounts unless expressly disclosed and agreed in writing by Member.

**5.5 Pass-through costs (third-party fees; no markup).** Member acknowledges that third parties may charge fees in connection with (i) submitting or supporting a Covered Claim and/or (ii) collecting Membership Dues (for example, payment processing fees assessed by a payment processor such as Stripe, record retrieval fees, or other Administrator- or vendor-imposed charges) (collectively, “**Pass-Through Costs**”).

If and only if Member **affirmatively authorizes** the applicable Pass-Through Costs (in the Platform or in writing) for a Covered Claim or for a specific payment transaction, Member agrees that Organization may charge Member for the **actual amount** of such Pass-Through Costs. Pass-Through Costs will be:

* **limited to the actual third-party fees incurred** (no markup by Organization);
* **disclosed to Member in advance** in a claim summary and/or payment checkout flow (including the method used to calculate the fee, if variable);
* **itemized or otherwise described** in the receipt or transaction confirmation made available to Member; and
* collected using Member’s payment method on file.

Unless explicitly stated in the authorization presented to Member, Pass-Through Costs are **in addition to** Membership Dues and do not reduce the Membership Dues percentage.

**5.6 When dues are owed.** Dues are owed only when Member receives Net Proceeds from a Covered Claim during an active membership term.

### 6) Membership Dues; Payment Method; Notices; Changes; Failures; Disputes

**6.1 Membership Dues.** In consideration of the Platform and Services, Member agrees to pay Membership Dues equal to \[PERCENT]% of the Value of Proceeds Received by Member from Covered Claims submitted through the Platform during an active membership term.

“Value of Proceeds Received” means the value of any payment or benefit Member receives from an Administrator for a Covered Claim, whether paid in cash or non-cash form, including (by example) checks, ACH credits, prepaid cards, vouchers, store credits, and gift cards.

* For gift cards, the Value of Proceeds Received is the face value of the gift card at issuance (e.g., a $100 gift card has a Value of Proceeds Received of $100).
* For vouchers/credits, the Value of Proceeds Received is the stated value communicated by the Administrator (or, if no stated value is provided, a reasonable good-faith estimate based on the Administrator’s published terms).
* Amounts reversed, clawed back, voided, or not finally received by Member are excluded.

Example: If Member receives a $100 gift card from an Administrator and the Membership Dues rate is 20%, Membership Dues are $20.

Membership Dues are not a charitable donation and are not intended to be tax-deductible.

**6.2 Payment method.**  Member agrees to maintain an approved payment method on file and authorizes Organization to collect Membership Dues using that payment method. Organization may use a third-party payment processor (for example, Stripe) to process payments.

Accepted payment methods may include ACH debit and/or debit/credit card (as made available in the Platform from time to time). Organization does not accept cash or checks.

If Member’s payment method fails, is blocked, is revoked, or is otherwise unavailable, Member remains responsible for Membership Dues owed, and Organization may suspend or terminate Member’s access to the Platform (including halting further submissions) until payment is resolved.

**6.3 Debit notices and scheduling.** Because Membership Dues may vary based on the Value of Proceeds Received, Organization will provide Member notice of the amount and scheduled collection date for each Membership Dues collection (a “Debit Notice”) via email and/or in-app notice.

Operational workflow (may vary by Administrator and payment rails):

* Organization may request confirmation from an Administrator that a payment is eligible to be issued to Member (a “Funding Confirmation”).
* After a Funding Confirmation, Organization may send a Debit Notice describing the Covered Claim, the expected form of proceeds (cash or non-cash), the calculated Membership Dues amount, and the scheduled collection date.
* Organization may transmit Member’s payment delivery instructions to the Administrator so the Administrator can initiate payment to Member.
* Member acknowledges that the Administrator controls timing and method of issuance, and Organization does not control posting order at Member’s financial institution or card issuer.

If Member notifies Organization that Member did not receive the proceeds described in a Debit Notice, Organization will investigate and, if appropriate, correct or reverse the associated Membership Dues collection consistent with Section 6.5 and Section 6.6.

**6.4 Changes to Membership Dues percentage.** Organization may change the Membership Dues percentage **only with advance notice**. Any change will:

1. be communicated with at least **\[30] days’** prior notice (or longer if required by law), and
2. take effect **prospectively** on the effective date stated in the notice (the “Effective Date”).

If Member does not agree to the updated percentage, Member may **opt out** by canceling membership **before** the Effective Date. If Member does not cancel before the Effective Date and continues to maintain an active membership on or after the Effective Date, the updated percentage will apply to **Value of Proceeds Received on or after** the Effective Date.

Organization will not apply a changed percentage retroactively to proceeds received before the Effective Date.

**6.5 Payment failures and nonpayment.** If a Membership Dues charge is returned, rejected, blocked, stopped, charged back, or otherwise fails (including NSF, stop-payment, closed account, invalid details, processor rejection, or revocation), Member remains responsible for the amount owed.

Organization may reattempt collection and/or reschedule collection after providing an updated Debit Notice where appropriate. Organization may suspend or terminate Member’s access to the Platform (including halting further submissions) for nonpayment or repeated payment failures.

**6.6 Billing questions and corrections.** If Member believes a charge is incorrect, Member must notify Organization at \[DISPUTE EMAIL] within \[30] days of the charge and provide reasonable details supporting the dispute. Organization will investigate and, if appropriate, refund or credit any verified overcharge.

### 7) Privacy and data use

**7.1** Organization will collect, use, and share Member information only as needed to perform the Services, including sharing with Administrators and vendors supporting the Services.

**7.2** Organization will maintain reasonable safeguards and publish a privacy notice describing categories of data collected and how it is used.

### 8) Member communications; consent

**8.1** Member consents to receive communications about Covered Claims and billing via email, SMS, and in-app notices (as selected).

**8.2** Member can change communication preferences, but disabling communications may reduce Organization’s ability to provide Services.

### 9) Limitations and disclaimers

**9.1 No fiduciary relationship.** Organization does not act as Member’s fiduciary, attorney, or financial advisor.

**9.2 No Administrator control.** Organization does not control settlement terms, Administrator processes, or payment timing.

### 10) Term, cancellation, suspension, and termination

**10.1 Term.** Membership begins upon acceptance and continues until canceled or terminated.

**10.2 Member cancellation; revocation.** Member may cancel membership and revoke Organization’s agency authority by:

* using the account portal cancellation flow; or
* emailing \[SUPPORT EMAIL] with subject “Cancel membership.”

**10.3 Effect of cancellation.** Cancellation stops future submissions and services. Membership Dues remain owed for Value of Proceeds Received from Covered Claims submitted during an active membership term. Member authorizes Organization to process any Membership Dues charges that were already scheduled and noticed prior to cancellation using Member’s **payment method on file** (including through Organization’s payment processor), unless Member updates or revokes the payment method in accordance with applicable law and processor rules.

**10.4 Nonpayment; suspension/termination.** Organization may suspend or terminate Member’s access to Services (including stopping all submissions) if:

* any Membership Dues debit fails, is returned, or is blocked;
* Member initiates a stop-payment or otherwise prevents collection of Membership Dues; or
* Member materially breaches this Agreement. Termination under this Section does not waive amounts owed; all Membership Dues accrued remain due and payable.

**10.5 Fraud/abuse.** Organization may immediately terminate membership for fraud, abuse, unlawful conduct, or intentional misuse of the Services.

### 11) Member representations

Member represents and warrants that:

* Member is the rightful claimant (or is otherwise authorized to submit on behalf of the claimant) for each Covered Claim;
* Member-provided information is truthful and accurate;
* Member understands Administrators may require identity verification and may reject submissions.

### 12) Indemnity

Member agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Organization from third-party claims arising from Member’s knowingly false submissions or intentional misuse of the Services.

### 13) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* Organization is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
* Organization’s aggregate liability is capped at Membership Dues actually collected from Member in the prior 12 months.

### 14) Dispute resolution; governing law

**14.1 Governing law:** \[STATE].\
**14.2 Venue / forum:** \[COURTS OF \_\_\_\_ COUNTY, STATE] or \[ARBITRATION DETAILS], with a small-claims carveout if desired.

### 15) Miscellaneous

**15.1 Entire agreement.** This Agreement (including Exhibits) is the entire agreement.

**15.2 Changes.** Updates must be provided to Member and accepted electronically or in writing.

**15.3 Severability.** If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains effective.

**15.4 Assignment.** Organization may assign to a successor; Member may not assign without consent.

**15.5 Electronic signatures.** Electronic acceptance and signatures are enforceable.
