# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** \[DATE]\
This Privacy Policy explains how **\[NONPROFIT LEGAL NAME]** (“**Organization**,” “**we**,” “**us**”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our websites, applications, and related services (collectively, the “**Platform**”).

This Policy should be read together with our Terms of Service and any authorized-agent or membership dues agreements you accept.

### 1) Key principles

* **We collect only what we need** to help you submit claim information and receive claim proceeds paid directly to you.
* **We do not take custody of claim proceeds.**
* **We do not sell** your personal information.
* We share information **only as needed** to provide the Platform, submit claims you authorize, process payments for membership dues, prevent fraud, and comply with law.

### 2) Information we collect

#### 2.1 Information you provide

Depending on how you use the Platform, you may provide:

* **Identity & contact information:** name, email, phone number, mailing address, date of birth (if required by an Administrator), and similar identifiers.
* **Claim-related information:** information you enter to support a claim submission (e.g., purchase/use details, dates, product identifiers, transaction details) and any documents you upload.
* **Payment information for dues:** bank account information for ACH debits, card information, billing address, and related transaction details (note: payment details may be collected and stored by our payment processor, not by us, depending on configuration).
* **Communications:** messages you send to us, support requests, and any responses you provide for transmission to an Administrator.

#### 2.2 Information collected automatically

When you use the Platform, we may collect:

* **Device and usage data:** IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, pages viewed, referring/exit pages, timestamps, and clickstream data.
* **Log data:** authentication events, error logs, and platform activity logs.
* **Cookies and similar technologies:** see Section 8.

#### 2.3 Information from third parties

We may receive information from:

* **Settlement administrators / payors** (e.g., claim status updates, requests for additional information, acceptance/denial outcomes).
* **Identity verification or fraud-prevention providers** (if used).
* **Payment processors** (e.g., confirmation of payment method, payment success/failure, chargebacks).
* **Service providers** that help operate the Platform (hosting, analytics, customer support tools).

### 3) How we use information

We use information to:

* **Operate the Platform** and provide the Services you request.
* **Submit Covered Claims** you affirmatively authorize and transmit information to Administrators.
* **Communicate with you** about claim status, Administrator requests, deadlines, and your account.
* **Calculate and collect Membership Dues** and manage payment issues (returns, failed payments, disputes).
* **Prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents** and protect the integrity of the Platform.
* **Improve and debug** the Platform (analytics, testing, product improvements).
* **Comply with law** and enforce our Terms, agreements, and policies.

#### Use of automation / AI

We may use automated systems (including AI-enabled tools) to help:

* pre-fill forms based on information you provide,
* detect missing required fields,
* route Administrator requests to you, and
* summarize or organize your information for submission.

**We do not use automation to provide legal advice or to make binding eligibility determinations.** The Administrator makes final eligibility and payment decisions.

### 4) How we share information

We share information only as described below:

#### 4.1 With settlement administrators and payors

We share the information you provide (and any documents you upload) with Administrators **only for Covered Claims you affirmatively authorize** and only to the extent needed to submit and support those claims and receive status updates.

#### 4.2 With service providers

We use vendors to help run the Platform (e.g., cloud hosting, customer support, analytics). They may process information on our behalf under contractual confidentiality and security obligations.

#### 4.3 With payment processors

We use payment processors (for example, Stripe) to process Membership Dues payments via ACH and/or card. Payment processors receive and process payment data and transaction metadata to complete payments and prevent fraud.

#### 4.4 For legal, safety, and compliance reasons

We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:

* comply with law, regulation, subpoena, or court order;
* protect the rights, safety, and security of members, the public, or the Organization;
* investigate fraud or misuse; or
* enforce our Terms and agreements.

#### 4.5 In a reorganization

If we undergo a merger, reorganization, dissolution, or asset transfer, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.

#### 4.6 We do not sell personal information

We do not sell your personal information and do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes in exchange for money.

### 5) Data retention

We retain information as long as needed to:

* provide the Platform and Services,
* maintain business records,
* resolve disputes,
* prevent fraud and abuse, and
* comply with legal obligations.

Retention periods vary by data type and context. For example, we may retain claim submission records and audit logs to demonstrate your authorizations and to support billing, dispute resolution, and compliance.

You may request deletion of your data as described in Section 7, subject to legal and operational retention needs.

### 6) Data security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.

No system is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for notifying us if you suspect unauthorized access.

### 7) Your choices and rights

#### 7.1 Account information

You can review and update certain account information through the Platform.

#### 7.2 Communications preferences

You can adjust communication preferences in your account settings (where available). Note that disabling certain communications may reduce our ability to provide time-sensitive claim updates.

#### 7.3 Access, deletion, and correction requests

Depending on your location, you may have rights to request:

* access to the personal information we hold about you,
* correction of inaccurate information, or
* deletion of information.

To submit a request, contact us at **\[PRIVACY EMAIL]**. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

#### 7.4 California privacy disclosures (if applicable)

If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), including rights to know, delete, correct, and opt out of certain sharing. We do not sell personal information.

We will provide any required notices and honor applicable rights upon verified request.

### 8) Cookies and similar technologies

We may use cookies, local storage, pixels, and similar technologies to:

* keep you logged in,

* measure performance and usage,
* prevent fraud, and
* improve the Platform.

You can control cookies through browser settings. Some features may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

### 9) Children’s privacy

The Platform is intended only for individuals **18 years of age or older**.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under **13**. If we learn that we collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.

If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us at **\[PRIVACY EMAIL]**.

### 10) United States only

The Platform is intended for use only by individuals located in the United States. We do not knowingly offer the Platform outside the United States.

By accessing or using the Platform, you represent that you are physically located in the United States at the time of use. We may use reasonable measures (such as IP-based geolocation, payment-country checks, and address validation) to enforce this restriction.

If we determine or reasonably suspect that you are accessing the Platform from outside the United States, we may restrict, suspend, or terminate your access without notice.

### 11) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice through the Platform or by email. The Effective Date at the top reflects the latest version.
