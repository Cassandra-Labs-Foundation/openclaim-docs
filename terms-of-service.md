# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** \[DATE]\
These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the websites, applications, and related services (collectively, the “**Platform**”) provided by **\[NONPROFIT LEGAL NAME]** (“**Organization**,” “**we**,” “**us**”).&#x20;

By creating an account, clicking “I agree,” or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

### 1) Who we are and what we do

The Organization provides a **ministerial, administrative service** to help individuals **submit claim information** and **receive claim proceeds** (e.g., settlement, restitution, refund, or similar payments) **paid directly to the individual** by a settlement administrator or other payor (each, an “**Administrator**”).

**We do not take custody of claim proceeds** and do not receive or distribute claim proceeds on your behalf.Claim proceeds move directly from the Administrator to Member using the payment instructions Member provides.

### 2) Not legal advice; no legal services

The Platform may provide general information about proceedings, claims processes, and required fields. **This is not legal advice.** We are **not** a law firm and do not provide legal services. Member does not grant Organization a power of attorney, express or implied. Organization’s authority is limited to the ministerial, claim-submission facilitation described in this Agreement.&#x20;

We do **not**:

* advise you whether to file, how to file, or which elections/options to choose;
* interpret legal rights or eligibility definitions as applied to your situation;
* provide a final legal opinion regarding your rights, remedies, or entitlement to payment;
* advocate, negotiate, contest denials, or pursue appeals on your behalf; or
* prepare sworn statements, affidavits, declarations, or other legal instruments for you.

#### Eligibility indicators (informational; not a legal determination)

The Platform may display an automated or staff-generated potential match based on your information and publicly available settlement criteria based on (a) the Administrator’s publicly available criteria or claim form requirements and (b) the information you provide. This indicator is **informational only** and is **not**:

* a legal opinion,
* a binding determination that you qualify,
* a guarantee that a claim will be accepted or paid, or
* a substitute for advice from a licensed attorney.

You remain responsible for deciding whether to submit a claim and for the accuracy and completeness of all information you submit. The Administrator (and, if applicable, the court or other authority) makes the final determination of eligibility and payment.

### 3) Eligibility to use the Platform

You must be at least **18 years old** (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and able to form a binding contract.

You may use the Platform only for **personal, non-commercial** purposes, unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing.

### 4) Account registration and security

You may need to create an account and provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for all activity under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of login credentials.

We may suspend or terminate accounts for suspected fraud, misuse, or breach of these Terms.

### 5) Covered Claims; your authorizations

A “**Covered Claim**” is a claim transmission that we prepare and transmit using information you provide **after** we send you a written **Transmission Notice** identifying the claim and you **do not opt out** within the **Opt-Out Period**.

**“Transmission Notice”** means a notice delivered by email and/or in-app message that (i) identifies the specific claim and the Administrator/payor, (ii) describes the key information we intend to transmit, and (iii) provides a clear method to opt out.

**“Opt-Out Period”** means **\[5] business days** after the Transmission Notice is sent (or such longer period stated in the Transmission Notice). If you opt out within the Opt-Out Period, we will not transmit that claim through the Platform.

You authorize us to:

* collect and transmit your information to Administrators for Covered Claims;
* communicate with Administrators for **ministerial purposes only**, such as status checks and transmission of your documents or your written responses; and
* provide your payment delivery instructions (including ACH information for **credits**, if supported) to Administrators **for payment directly to you**.

**We will not respond to substantive Administrator questions** (e.g., eligibility interpretation, evidentiary sufficiency, elections, disputes/appeals) other than to relay the request to you and transmit your written response as directed.

### 6) Membership Dues; payment method; changes

#### 6.1 Membership Dues (including non-cash payments)

In consideration of the Platform and Services, you agree to pay **Membership Dues** equal to **\[PERCENT]%** of the **Value of Proceeds Received** by you from Covered Claims transmitted through the Platform during an active membership term.

* **“Value of Proceeds Received”** means the value of any payment or benefit you receive from an Administrator for a Covered Claim, whether paid in **cash or non-cash form**, including (by example) checks, ACH credits, prepaid cards, vouchers, store credits, and **gift cards**.
* For **gift cards**, the Value of Proceeds Received is the **face value** of the gift card at issuance (e.g., a $100 Amazon gift card has a Value of Proceeds Received of $100).
* For **vouchers/credits**, the Value of Proceeds Received is the stated value communicated by the Administrator (or, if no stated value is provided, a reasonable good-faith estimate based on the Administrator’s published terms).
* Amounts reversed, clawed back, voided, or not finally received by you are excluded.

**Example:** If you receive a **$100 gift card** from an Administrator, and your Membership Dues rate is **20%**, your Membership Dues are **$20**.

Membership Dues are **not a charitable donation** and are not intended to be tax-deductible.

#### 6.2 Payment method (payment processor; no cash/check)

You agree to maintain an approved **payment method on file** and authorize us to collect Membership Dues using that payment method. We may use a third-party payment processor (for example, **Stripe**) to process payments.

Accepted payment methods may include **ACH debit** and/or **debit/credit card** (as made available in the Platform from time to time). We do not accept cash or checks.

If your payment method fails, is blocked, or is revoked, you remain responsible for Membership Dues owed, and we may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform (including halting further transmissions) until payment is resolved.

#### 6.3 Changes to Membership Dues percentage (notice + opt-out; prospective only)

We may change the Membership Dues percentage **only with advance notice**. Any change to the Membership Dues percentage will:

1. Be communicated to you with at least **\[30] days’** prior notice (or longer if required by law), and
2. Take effect **prospectively** on the effective date stated in the notice (the “Effective Date”).

If you do not agree to the updated percentage, you may **opt out** by canceling your membership **before** the Effective Date. If you do not cancel before the Effective Date and you continue to maintain an active membership on or after the Effective Date, the updated percentage will apply to **Value of Proceeds Received on or after** the Effective Date.

We will not apply a changed percentage retroactively to proceeds you received before the Effective Date, and any Covered Claim proceeds received before the Effective Date will be subject to the Membership Dues percentage in effect at the time those proceeds were received.

#### 6.4 Payment failures and nonpayment

If a Membership Dues charge is returned, rejected, blocked, stopped, or otherwise fails (including NSF, stop-payment, closed account, invalid details, or chargeback), you remain responsible for the amount owed.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform (including halting further transmissions) for nonpayment or repeated failed payments.

#### 6.5 Billing questions and corrections

If you believe a charge is incorrect, you must notify us at **\[DISPUTE EMAIL]** within **\[30] days** of the charge. If we confirm an overcharge, we will refund or credit the overcharged amount.

### 7) Your information; your certifications

You represent and warrant that:

* you are the rightful claimant for each Covered Claim (or you are otherwise authorized to transmit the claimant’s submission on the claimant's behalf);
* all information you provide is truthful, accurate, and complete; and
* you will promptly update information if it changes.

Administrators may require identity verification and may deny or delay payments for any reason.

### 8) Prohibited conduct

You may not:

* use the Platform to impersonate others or submit false or misleading information;
* use the Platform for unlawful activity, harassment, or abuse;
* reverse engineer or interfere with Platform security;
* scrape, extract, or reuse Platform content at scale;
* use the Platform to provide services to third parties for compensation (commercial use) without our written consent.

### 9) Communications; electronic notices; consent

You consent to receive communications from us electronically (email, in-app notices, and if you opt in, SMS), including:

* claim status updates and Administrator requests,
* Membership Dues debit notices,
* policy and Terms updates.

Electronic communications satisfy any legal “writing” requirements where permitted by law.

### 10) Privacy

Our collection, use, and sharing of information is governed by our **Privacy Notice** located at **\[PRIVACY URL]**. We share your information with Administrators and service providers only as necessary to operate the Platform and transmit Covered Claims you authorize.

### 11) Intellectual property

We and our licensors own the Platform and all related intellectual property. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform for personal, non-commercial purposes.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or create derivative works from the Platform except as permitted by law or with our written permission.

### 12) Third-party services and links

The Platform may reference or link to third-party sites or services (including Administrator portals). We do not control and are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is subject to their terms.

### 13) Disclaimers

THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT:

* ANY CLAIM WILL BE ACCEPTED OR PAID,
* ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT WILL BE PAID,
* ANY PARTICULAR TIMELINE WILL APPLY, OR
* THE PLATFORM WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

### 14) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE PLATFORM OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF MEMBERSHIP DUES ACTUALLY COLLECTED FROM YOU IN THE **12 MONTHS** BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

(Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, these limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.)

### 15) Indemnification (narrow)

You agree to indemnify and hold the Organization harmless from third-party claims arising from your knowing submission of false information, fraud, or intentional misuse of the Platform.

### 16) Termination

You may stop using the Platform at any time and may cancel membership through **\[CANCEL FLOW]** or by emailing **\[SUPPORT EMAIL]**.

We may suspend or terminate your access if you:

* violate these Terms,
* submit fraudulent information,
* interfere with Platform security, or
* fail to pay Membership Dues (including repeated failed or blocked payments (including ACH or card), or chargebacks).

Termination does not eliminate amounts owed for Membership Dues that accrued based on Net Proceeds you received during an active membership term.

### 17) Governing law; venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of **\[STATE]**, excluding conflict-of-laws rules.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Platform will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **\[COUNTY, STATE]**, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

(If you prefer arbitration, insert a tailored arbitration section here and ensure it matches your consumer-law strategy.)

### 18) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice. **If a change affects Membership Dues percentage or other key economic terms, we will require your affirmative acceptance** (click-to-accept) before the change applies to you.
